Printed Text Scanner

This project is a simple GUI application that scans printed text using PyTesseract. It allows you to load images or use a live camera, select a region of interest, run OCR, and view the extracted text directly inside the interface. The app also provides an overlay preview so you can see exactly what text was detected.

Purpose

This project was created as part of an AI Without ML assignment to explore and understand how classical OCR systems work.

How It Works

Open the app, load an image or use your camera, select the area you want scanned, and let the OCR engine extract the text for you. The results appear instantly in the GUI.

Demo

A short video (20–40 seconds) shows the app running, scanning an image, and displaying the extracted text.
